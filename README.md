## Introduction

The "Smart Home Control Panel" is an Arduino-based project that allows you to remotely control two LEDs through a web interface. This project provides a simplified interface for users to manage specific home automation tasks.

## Features

- Control two LEDs through a web interface.
- Web-based control panel for remote access.
- User-friendly interface for LED management.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno).
- Two LEDs.
- ESP-01 module for wireless communication.
- Arduino IDE for code compilation.
- Appropriate libraries for web server functionality.

## Hardware Setup

To set up the hardware for this project, follow the instructions provided in the Arduino code. This includes connecting the LEDs and the ESP-01 module to the Arduino board as per the specified pin configurations. Wiring diagrams and connections should be detailed in the code comments.

- Connect the ESP-01 module to the Arduino board following the instructions in the code comments. You may need to use voltage level shifters to ensure proper communication between the ESP-01 module and the Arduino.

## Software Setup

Before using the Smart Home Control Panel, ensure you have the following software set up:

1. Arduino IDE: Install the Arduino IDE to compile and upload the provided code to your Arduino board.

2. Required Libraries: Install the necessary libraries for the web server functionality. These libraries are essential for the project's functionality.

## Usage

1. Compile and upload the provided Arduino code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

2. Connect the hardware components as per the instructions in the code comments and wiring diagrams, including the ESP-01 module.

3. Power up your Arduino board.

4. Access the web-based control panel using the IP address of your ESP-01 module. You should be able to control the two LEDs from this interface.
